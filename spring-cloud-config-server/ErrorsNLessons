Error : 

No spring.config.import property has been defined
 
Action:

Add a spring.config.import=configserver: property to your configuration.   
If configuration is not required add spring.config.import=optional:configserver: instead.
To disable this check, set spring.cloud.config.enabled=false or 
spring.cloud.config.import-check.enabled=false.

Answer :
The Reason

Spring Cloud Config Client has changed and technically bootstrap.properties and bootstrap.yml files are deprecated.

Correct Solution

Move all properties from boostrap.properties to application.properties (it can be .yml as well)
Remove bootstrap.properties file
Replace spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888 with spring.config.import=configserver:http://localhost:8888
This is a proper way to tell you Spring Boot app that you want to load properties from the Spring Cloud Config service that is running on localhost:8888.

Legacy Solution

In case you want to use a legacy bootstrap.properties file, you just need to add the following dependency:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-bootstrap</artifactId>
</dependency>
Please note that this is a deprecated mechanism, so if you're creating a new project, go ahead with the correct solution.

Error :
when ever you see error at annotations that means it is missing its dependency pkg !
